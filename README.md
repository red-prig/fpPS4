  PS4 compatibility layer (emulator) written with Free Pascal
 
This project is currently at the beginning and started for fun.
 
### Building
- Free Pascal compiler: 3.3.1 (use fpcupdeluxe with trunk), x86_64 only. 
- Lazarus: 2.0.0 and higher, x86_64 only. 

### Minimum system requirements 

- OS: Windows 7 SP1 x64 and higher 
- CPU: x64, AVX2 support
- GPU: Vulkan API support

### Game compatibility tracker
https://github.com/red-prig/fpps4-game-compatibility/issues

### Control layout
To switch to borderless full screen mode, press Alt-Enter.

fpPS4 supports XInput-compatible gamepads natively. You can remap buttons by pressing Esc on the keyboard during emulation. 
Regardless, you can use a keyboard as a input.
A DualShock4 touchpad is emulated by the mouse.
